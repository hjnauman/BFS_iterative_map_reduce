# BFS_iterative_map_reduce
This project implemented BFS over an input graph via an iterative map reduce algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm was used to find the shortest path between the various nodes in the input graph. Each output graph directory shows an itteration of the map reduce algorithma and the values of each node output by multiple reducers.
